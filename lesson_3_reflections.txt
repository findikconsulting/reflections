When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would use a remote repsitory for a way to backup and also to share with others, who can view or download or work on them together.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  It might vreate merge problems as the local repository could be committed forward then remote one.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  If I want to use  an existing and from me reachable GitHub repository I would fork it to make a new forked GitHub repository. 
  If I want get a remote repository for my own usage I would clone it.
  If I want to add or try some new feature without making changes on a master (stable version) I would it branch it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  If we know the last state of the remote so we can fast forward merge if it is accessible from local head.
