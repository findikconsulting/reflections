When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would use a remote repsitory for a way to backup and also to share with others, who can view or download or work on them together.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  It might vreate merge problems as the local repository could be committed forward then remote one.
