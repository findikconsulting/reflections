What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	To let Git start tracking my files I need initialize a repository. I think INIT will create .git folder where it can track the changes and take snapshots.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	It is intermediary area where I can work with files before committing.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	Git ADD the file or files with the only logic change and Git COMMIT with message of the logic change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	Branches can help me create new features and experimenting on them without adding them to main project.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Diagrams can help me to visualize the branches and "of detached" commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	To add additional feature which was independently worked on a seperate branch with the main project.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	If there is no conflict on changes on two different versions then automatic is time saving versus where you need to do manual conflict resolving and file merging to keep the wanted functionality.
