How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	I am able to compare two files with FC command in DOS. It will show up differences on files. It easier to find in bigger files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	It is easier to rollback to previous version if there is a bug in my coding.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    	It is easier to remember what commits are done when done manually to compare to Google Docs which deosn't differantiate on logicals parts.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    	Git allows make commits with multiple files as it is part of the logic to work with multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    	First get the commit id through git log and use the git diff to see differences between earlier version.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    	It easier revert back to working code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    	I will try making changes on my code.
